 What We Did in This Learning LAB  

In this project, we worked through the entire process of data analysis and predictive modeling. We started by **acquiring and preparing the dataset**, ensuring it was clean and ready for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers. We also explored and summarized the dataset using statistical and descriptive analysis techniques.  

Next, we applied **feature engineering** techniques, including dimensionality reduction (PCA), feature selection (filter-based and wrapper-based methods), and encoding categorical variables. If the dataset had imbalanced classes, we addressed it using appropriate resampling methods.  

For **predictive modeling**, we trained and evaluated **Linear Regression and Decision Tree models**, assessing their performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R-squared. We documented each step, including key observations and justifications for our decisions.
